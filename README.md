# StartYourDay

Start_Your_Day brings you a few warm-up ideas, factoids and possibilities to get each day going. It tells you the date and the day of the year, to help you locate yourself in time. Then it offers you a daily meditation, word, five awesome ideas, a writing tip and a word of the day. You can choose whether to see all of these, or choose among them). When done — exit and get a “follow your passion today message.”
